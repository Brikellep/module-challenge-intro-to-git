## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is an open source software for version control, or a mini file system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git allows you to keep track of code history, GitHub is an open source 
code website.
3. Why do we create a branch?
Branches allow you to add in your code for features, bug fixes, etc, 
safely without completely changing others code. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
It allows you to tell others the changes you made in a repository.

git checkout "FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME"
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch takes the changes, git merge merges the changes made, and git pull pulls those changes into your working repository.
7. What is a merge conflict?
When people make the changes to the same line of the same file in different branches of a repository.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You must resolve it locally on the command line.First pull request, click pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve, then near the bottom of the pull 
request, click resolve conflicts.
